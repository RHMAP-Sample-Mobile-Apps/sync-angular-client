fh-rest-client-template
=======================

This is a sample front end for _feedhenry-staff/fh-rest-sync-proxy-template_,
and _feedhenry-staff/fh-rest-mbaas-template_. You can run both of those
applications locally using the instructions in the README.md for each. Once
those are running you can start this using:

```
cd fh-rest-client-template
npm install
npm start
```

This will open the application in a browser (only Chrome is tested) and allow
you to interact with the local Cloud (fh-rest-sync-proxy-template) and Service
(fh-rest-mbaas-template) to create users.
